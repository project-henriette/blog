One day, probably bored or just looking for something new, I was searching social media channels and I saw an announcement of free spinning mini-workshop and I thought I might give it a spin. At the workshp there were several different spinning wheels and some nice combed wool. It was a satisfying process, watching fluff becoming stuff, well, yarn. But at the beginning, I didn’t know if this is the journey I want to take for a long term or it will leave me soon, so the commitment of buying a spinning wheel was way too big. But there were also spindles. So this was I think three years ago.

## Drop spindles

The investment was quite small, some fluff and a basic spindle for beginners. I liked the Turkish spindle, it is foldable and it creates nice small balls of yarn from the start. My first yarn (I still keep it) was very uneven, it varied from sport to chunky and I didn’t find quite a good use for it yet. But it was the first try. For the second try I got leftovers from felting projects my friend was getting rid off, and to my surprise, it looked good. And I was hooked.
I started my learning path mostly on Youtube, continued with some spindling with the Craftsy platform classes. I still don’t remember all the terms and I am not sure I do all the things right, but I love time spending with my spindle and I am really proud of the skeins that come out from it.
Turkish spindle that I bought has approx. 60g and is not really suitable for spinning thin yarns. It is better to either go for thicker singles or use it for plying. In order to create thin singles suitable for plying I got another drop spindle of 25g weight. And I am learning and discovering new things every time I touch it. 

## Yarn of my dreams

Let me say, it is a long term project when I decide to spin, ply and knit out of it. The yarn is invaluable by the time and effort I need to give it, so from the start, I knew it makes no sense to create yarns from cheap materials. And oh, what pleasure it gives to work with soft merino, silk, nicely combed wools, and the smell, the smell!
Spinning is a very tactile work. It needs sensitive fingertips and it awakens senses. I found out that I prefer to stand when spinning, rather than sitting, because I can draft longer yarn before I have to wind it on the spindle. With hands slightly above my head I feel like a dnacer. I have the combed roving wrapped around one arm and I get completely lost in full sensual and motion experience. I don’t control the perfect twist count, I don’t go for even drafts unless I need it. I watch the fibres leave the cloud and change into a single strand, I peek at the spindle to adjust the speed. The whole process is absolutely quiet. I go with the intuition rather than over control the process.
What is my goal when I spin the yarn myself? I want something that I can’t buy or I can’t afford to buy. I choose the technique and/or colour combination that might be hard to get from mass-produced goods. I am trying to see the resulting object that could be created out of it or a stitch pattern I could use. I am also still in experimenting mode - what would happen with this type of roving if I made this lightly spun single plied double? What would resulting fabric look like? How would it behave in fabric? Oh, options, they are endless.

## Letting go of perfection

Learning the technique often requires to start with basics, and in this case, it means producing a consistent yarn. Once I realized it is something I can already achieve I was quite happy that I can work this way, but I have also noticed I have created yarn that is similar to what I can buy. It is that experimental and imperfect side I was more drawn to. All these imperfect parts of too much roving in one place, bumps of softness, more twist and less twist, coils and embellishments in the yarn are the spice that makes me look forward to the next project.
There is a difference to a beginner’s imperfect yarn and an imperfect yarn I work on purpose. By design I decide where the yarn would leave the general rule of what it should look like. But I keep some general character and I also think about how the yarn is going to be used next, and how many twists it will need to be plied later and hold well together. I also think about what post-processes I will use to stabilize the newly spun yarn.

## Public spin

Yes, I tried taking my spinning to cafe and spin while my friends were knitting. I have to say it is not very common thing to see in a public space that is not a museum, so it draws some attention. Plus I am standing most of the time. Sometimes I enjoy explaining what I am doing but not always. I tried, now I only take knitting to public crafting events.

## Where I still want to get

I am still at the beginning of my journey, but I already know I should get better at writing down what I am working on, what my initial idea was, how twisted the yarn should be, write down the general thickness and samples of single and final yarn. I want to experiment more with blending colours as I spin, trying embellishments like coils, using different roving as a decorative feature, beads, there is still so much magic undiscovered and so many ways to take.

## Spinning for beginners and how not to get frustrated

Watching videos might give the basic instruction, but it often skips all the important steps of troubleshooting and what material to start with. I was lucky to ask in the shop and I got long-staple wool that had a good amount of grease in it and was quite easy to work with. Starting with short-staple wools or soft merinos might bring a lot of frustration. Also - spindle weight is important. Starting with making a thin single as I saw it in the video was nearly impossible with the 60g spindle I bought at first. It was too heavy and pulled down the fibres to a very thin yarn that would eventually break. As it was happening often, it was not satysfying experience and I thought it was my inexperience rather than wrong choice of tooling. Once I realized it is the spindle weight that creates the problem and got a smaller one the success came. The frustration turned into the flow, work turned into pleasure. I could focus on the sensual experience, the texture of fibres, smell of yarn and enjoy the spin. I would definitely appreciate a spinning friend who could encourage me with some cheerful words and a good piece of advice for my first spin. But not everyone knows such person and then it is a good time to start searching for helpful crafting communities. 

## TLDR

To avoid frustration pick a good spinning buddy to show you how to start, buy very forgiving beginner roving and go for middle range weight of spindle (around 40g).
