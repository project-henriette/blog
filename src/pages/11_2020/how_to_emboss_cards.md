I don’t remember when we have really stopped to care and send Christmas cards. It used to be a great tradition before we all got cell phones and smartphones and then we have switched to fancy rhyme text wishes or digital postcards that are sent in a second to everyone in our e-mails, phone books, and on social media. Even to those we have never met and don’t really care about. Is this really a way to show we do care?

## Making Christmas cards

This year was a mess. And everyone is tired and anxious to get back to normal. Social circles (and I am talking about the people you really meet in person) are somehow disrupted, friendships are weaker, families separated. I haven’t seen some of my work colleagues since March. Yeah, and we don’t even talk anymore. Because kitchen chit chat over coffee in the morning and a zoom call are a completely different experience. How do I show that I care for that person? With a personal card.

## Embossing paper

So this is my go-to art technique for Christmas cards. I already tried some samples, I was happy with some results, and after showing them on my personal Facebook page I have decided to describe the process so whoever lands on this page can try it too. Step by step.

## Materials

- Paper for the pattern - I have used cardboard - the backside of the color paper book, dense, 1,5 - 2mm thick paper
- Exacto knife - or any very sharp knife that allows you to create detailed work. Use a sharp blade, not like me. A blunt blade makes the whole process a little hell.
- Some pencil to mark the design
- Eraser - clean the pattern before embossing
- Something to emboss with - I used a crochet hook - it’s made of metal, it has a rounded tip and a comfortable handle. Don’t use sharp objects that might pierce the paper.
- Cutting mat - don’t destroy your table
- Tape to hold the paper and pattern and double sided tape
- Paper to emboss - I have used aquarelle paper (160g/ m2), a heavier paper of a good quality advised. I tried color paper as well before and it was prone to tear
- Watercolors, inks, markers, color pencils to finish the card
 
## Step by step to emboss like a boss:

1. Sketch the design you want to emboss. Embossing means that the design is going to raise from the paper. Debossing is the design indented into the paper. Simple shapes only have one raising line, so splitting the shape into small particles creates a much more intriguing effect. [Embossing on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_embossing)

2. Cut the pieces out using the Exacto knife. With complex designs start at the center and go outwards. Using a sharp blade will help you cut the pieces precisely and without tear-out. Clean the pencil marks with an eraser. I skipped this step at first and I was very sorry later.

3. Place the paper over the pattern. You will emboss on the wrong side of the paper to have the shape raising on the other side. So to emboss the front of the card you need to open it and work there. Lift it against the light source to see the pattern through the paper if you need to see it better. With this setup, I have created random hearts I will later randomly emboss into different cards. If you will create more cards with the same design it is better to place them on edge or mark the spot to place the paper. Fix the paper with tape.

4. Using your embossing tool of choice (rounded side of a spoon would work well here too) lightly rub over the paper. Always do the rubbing / pressing part on the wrong side of the paper. It has a bit of shine and marks of the tool you use and it doesn’t look good.

5. Using the embossing tool press around the sides of the pattern to create the edge of the cutout shape. Rub over the center to press it through the cutout onto the mat. Go in multiple steps to prevent tearing the paper.

6. Debossing - showing the difference in effect. I use pattern #2 I have cut out - but not the card with cutout pieces but the cutout shape. I have taped the shape on the mat and placed the card over it. I embossed the outer line of the heart shape.

![Debossed heart shape on the wrong side](./diy_emboss_process6.jpg)

And here is the result - the first heart shape is embossed, the second heart with its pattern is debossed

7. Embossing and debossing an outline. I have secured the main pattern board and a cutout piece with double-sided tape. I have pressed both edges first and then shaped the center a bit. This is the way to create a pattern with a continuous outline.

And the result:

8. More complex shapes require taping the card to the place to prevent it from moving. You will need to check if the shape is how you intended it to be or if there is a piece missing - you’ll need to lift the paper to look at the pattern. Go over the shape lightly at first to see the position and then press the edges. Press the centers. Lift the paper when you feel like some parts are missing or to check the pattern below.

9. Now the pinnacle of the embossing journey. To place the pattern lift the cardboard pattern and the embossed paper against the light. Rub over the area lightly at first, then emboss the edges. I would recommend startting from the center of the piece going outwards. Make sure you don't forget any particle, otherwise the shape might end up incomplete.

10. Finish the front of your card using markers, watercolors, pencil… or leave it as it is. I have left the pencil on the pattern and it pressed into the front, so I had to camouflage the mistake with some more pencil marks. It is not really possible to use eraser on embossed paper without destroying your previous hard work.

## Troubleshooting

- I tore the paper - try thicker paper or thinner pattern cardboard. Go slower when pressing paper. Be more patient and gentle.
- I embossed from the other side - start again. Or cover the ugly marks with some colors or pencil marks. It worked for me.


To finish this how-to emboss I would love to end with some poetic note: I didn’t make those cards to sell them, so they are by far not perfect. I was just having fun trying a new technique, combining the shapes with nice colors, adding the lettering. I hope they will please the receiver and inspire someone to make some cards or try embossing.
