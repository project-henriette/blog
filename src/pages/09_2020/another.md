I love to scroll through pinterest and DIY blogs to see all the amazing things people do, those things I can try as well. I get inspired, I get excited, I try and...

So I already made my first ink from elderberry, with some minor success (it behaves like ink), so the first anxiety was gone. Let's go with avocado this time.

Avocados were on sale, and avocado pink is probably the most fashionable shade of pink nowadays. True dream of a millenial I am not. This is supposed to be a fail blog post, to be honest. 

So these are some of the recipes I have found:

I went through the posts, it seemed easy as pie, I had all the tools and ingredients. I was especially impressed with the idea of grating the stone of the avocado as the guy did in the video. It is the best way to release most of the colour, right?

I cleaned the skins and the stones from the pulp remains (most of it served as guacamole), tore the skins into smaller pieces and grated the stones. It made quite a good amount of material. I added water to cover all solids and started cooking.

When the mixture started to bubble, I added a spoonful of soda ash and it immediately turned into dark red colour. Success! Next step was to simmer it for 20 minutes. After ten minutes I prepared a strip of paper to test out the intensity of my ink, dipped it into the pot and ... the paper was covered with a lovely shade of GOO. 

Goo is a fantastic word. It means something unpleasantly sticky. The colour was nice, intense, but the texture was not inky. Inky means fluid. This was a pot of marmelade.

I gave myself a couple of minutes of panic. I added more water. It created more fluid goo. Okay, let's pretend this is fine and let's just continue with the next step - pass it through a siege and possibly through a paper filter.

Goo and some remains of skins was a good fun to pass throught the siege. Reminded me of lumpy gravy. The material from the siege was very sticky and wouldn't go through the funnel by itself. How to save the day and have at least a little bit of ink? I diluted a bit of goo and tried to put it through the paper filter. It produced a bit of nice and clean soft shaded ink. But most of it was just stuck in the filter. 

I decided to pass the most of the goo through a piece of fabric. Which means a lot of sqeezing by hand, because the goo really didn't want to get through the fabric by itself. Both my hands were millenial avocado bloody. It took forever. I have no idea why anyone would need to add gum arabic to make it more glossy. The result is quite thick liquid of nice shade. Every surface in the kitchen shows some marks of avocado activity. And my hands, oh my.

My avocado hands are going to represent this little joy for a couple of days, this was a true zen activity of making this hipster ink.

P.S.: I couldn't resist and tried it on a piece of paper. It actually looks good. So next batch of avocados?
